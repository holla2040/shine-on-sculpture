# ðŸ§Š Baby Step 3 â€” Break a Cube Into Separate Flat Panels

This step teaches you how to split the faces of a cube into separate flat mesh objects. This is useful for preparing components that will later be spaced or labeled individually.

## Step-by-step

1. **Add a cube**:
   - `Shift + A` â†’ Mesh â†’ Cube.

2. **Enter Edit Mode**:
   - Select the cube and press `Tab`.
   - Press `3` to activate Face Select mode.

3. **Separate each face**:
   - Select one face at a time.
   - Press `P` â†’ **Selection**.
   - Repeat until all 6 faces are separated into their own objects.

4. **Return to Object Mode**:
   - Press `Tab`.
   - You now have 6 separate panels in the same location.

5. **Move and inspect**:
   - Select each panel.
   - Press `G` to move it away slightly to inspect.
   - Use `R` to rotate them for exploded views.

6. **Rename panels for organization**:
   - Open the **Outliner** panel.
   - Rename each panel (e.g. "Top", "Front", "Left").

7. **Group or parent if needed**:
   - Select all â†’ `Ctrl + G` to create a group.
   - Or `Ctrl + P` to parent them under an empty object.
