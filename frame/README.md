# Blender Baby Steps: Independent Tutorials for Sculpture Projects

## üìù Project Summary

This repository contains a series of **independent, self-contained Blender tutorials** designed for a true beginner. 
Each tutorial walks through a small, concrete Blender modeling task ‚Äî such as flattening a mesh to SVG, 
engraving labels, simulating print layers, or scripting geometry with Python.

These baby steps are intended to help build components for a physical **sculpture project**, and each step can be run standalone. 
There is no dependency between steps ‚Äî they are meant to be **learn-by-example snapshots** covering key Blender techniques.

This documentation was developed collaboratively using ChatGPT and refined iteratively to ensure:
- Realistic beginner workflows using Blender 4.1 or later
- Clean, linear instructions for each operation
- Reusable, versioned Markdown files with one step per file

The repository structure includes:
- A top-level `README.md` with this project summary and Table of Contents
- A `blender_baby_steps/` folder with individual `.md` files for each tutorial step

Each tutorial can be printed, tracked, or edited individually to suit the needs of your sculpture fabrication or design workflow.

Each tutorial below is **fully self-contained**, designed for a **Blender novice**, and written using Blender 4.1+.
